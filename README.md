### Portfolio page

This is my personal portfolio page, adapted from the design covered in the ['Getting Started with CSS'](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-css/) course on FrontEndMasters. The site primarily uses HTML and CSS, with the exception of fade-in animations and a responsive nav-bar.
